# Gorenje Spartacus clone
As part of my internship with a company Gorenje, I was instructed to create a clone of the official [gorenje website](https://si.gorenje.com/), with a new technology - Spartacus.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
